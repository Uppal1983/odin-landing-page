# odin-landing-page
The Odin Project - Landing Page Project

Landing page based 100% on the design provided by TOP at the end of the CSS module in the foundations part of the course.

I am showcasing everything I've learned thus far:

-Using appropriate HTML with divs for the first time
-Using CSS based on everything learned thus far
-Using Flex method for placing items in the right place and nesting containers
